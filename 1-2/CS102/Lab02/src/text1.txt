A shoemaker named Simon, who had neither house nor land of his own, lived with his
wife and children in a peasant's hut, and earned his living by his work. Work was
cheap, but bread was dear, and what he earned he spent for food. The man and his
wife had but one sheepskin coat between them for winter wear, and even that was
torn to tatters, and this was the second year he had been wanting to buy sheep-skins
for a new coat. Before winter Simon saved up a little money: a three-rouble note lay
hidden in his wifeâ€™s box, and five roubles and twenty kopeks were owed him by
customers in the village.
