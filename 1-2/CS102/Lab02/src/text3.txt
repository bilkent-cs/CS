He came to the village and called at a peasant's hut, but the man was not at home.
The peasant's wife promised that the money should be paid next week, but she would
not pay it herself. Then Simon called on another peasant, but this one swore he had no
money, and would only pay twenty kopeks which he owed for a pair of boots Simon
had mended. Simon then tried to buy the sheep-skins on credit, but the dealer would
not trust him.

"Bring your money," said he, "then you may have your pick of the skins. We know what
debt-collecting is like." So all the business the shoemaker did was to get the twenty
kopeks for boots he had mended, and to take a pair of felt boots a peasant gave him
to sole with leather.
