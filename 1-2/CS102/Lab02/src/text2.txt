So one morning he prepared to go to the village to buy the sheep-skins. He put on
over his shirt his wife's wadded nankeen jacket, and over that he put his own cloth
coat. He took the three-rouble note in his pocket, cut himself a stick to serve as a staff,
and started off after breakfast. "I'll collect the five roubles that are due to me,"
thought he, "add the three I have got, and that will be enough to buy sheep-skins for
the winter coat."
